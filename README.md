# Chemistry Building Blocks v2

A modular enhancement or extension for the Chemistry Building Blocks Word-based educational toolkit. This version builds upon the original [Chemistry Building Blocks](https://github.com/String-sg/Chemistry-Building-Blocks) macro-enabled system used to teach atomic structure, bonding, and the periodic table.

## 🔗 Base System Requirement

This version (`v2`) is **not standalone**. It requires the original macro-enabled base system:

- `Chemistry Building Blocks_StartUp_v5.dotm`
- Installed Microsoft Word with macros enabled
- Base files (`.dotx`, `.dotm`) found in the [Chemistry Building Blocks Main Repository](https://github.com/String-sg/Chemistry-Building-Blocks)

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Download the base system** from:
   ```
   https://github.com/String-sg/Chemistry-Building-Blocks
   ```

2. **Install this v2 module**:
   - Copy or merge the contents of this repo into the same directory as the base `.dotm` files
   - Ensure any macro references or modules are updated using the Word Developer tab > Macros > Organizer

3. **Open the StartUp Template**:
   - Open `Chemistry Building Blocks_StartUp_v5.dotm`
   - Enable macros when prompted
   - Use new features and extensions provided in `v2`

## 🚀 Features in v2

- Enhanced activity blocks for building chemical compounds
- Improved interface templates
- Additional macro scripts (if included in `.txt` or `.bas` form)
- Compatibility improvements with modern Word versions

## 💡 Suggested Enhancements

- 🧬 Auto-marking functionality
- 🌐 Export to HTML or web format for browser delivery
- 📊 Logging and progress tracking per student
- 🔐 Add licensing or login layer for secure classroom use
